# Mobileye (~120h challenge):

Detecting traffic lights and the distance to them on runtime within given video using image processing and machine learning, in a long project separated into 4 parts using Python:

### Phase_I - Traffic Lights attention
Detection of source lights in an image using convolution with customized high-pass filter and peak_local_max function.

### Phase_II - Traffic Lights detection
Generating and training CNN using the products of the previous stage as input, to conclude all the traffic lights in the image (using tensorflow).

### Phase_III - Find the distance of the Traffic Lights
Estimating the distance to each detected traffic light from the camera picturing the images of interest, involving geometric and linear algebra calculations.

### Phase_IV - Software Integration
Integrating all previous parts into a functional and intuitive SW product.
